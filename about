      <h3>Heronz is a mathematician and bird from New Zealand</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heron of Alexandria</li>
        <p>Heron was a Greek mathematician, geometer, engineer, and inventor from Alexandria, Roman Egypt (c. 10 AD – c. 70 AD). He is known to have developed the first steam-engine, vending machine, wind-powered organ, and more. Heron is also known for his formula of calculating the area of a triangle from three sides. Can you find it on our homepage?</p>
        <li>White Heron</li>
        <p>The white heron, or kōtuku, is a rare native bird in New Zealand. It can be identified by its white feathers, long neck, yellow bill, and dark legs. Due to its rarity and elegance, the white heron appears frequently in Māori myths.</p>

      <h3>In the beginning, there was AIC First</h3>
      <p style="float: right;">Created in 2016 by two AIC students, AIC First offered tutoring in mathematics, English, and science every Saturday morning at a church in Auckland. For two hours, AIC students taught in front of tutees of all ages, nationalities, and difficulties. International English tutoring through Skype was tested in the final months of AIC First. This is the prototypes is the prototype of Heronz.</br></br>AIC First closed down and came back renewed, refreshed, and restructured in March as Heronz. We send a big thank you to those who held on to us through the wait. Welcome back.</p>
